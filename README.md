# Arkanoid

## The project
This is a recreation of the famous arcade game "Arkanoid".

- We decided to build this game as a group project because it contained many aspects that we deemed interesting: collisions, score counting,
game management and user input.
- This version of Arkanoid is different from others because it's possible to select the amount of cells, their size, and the position they take in the screen.
This is thanks to the fact that we made the dimensions and positions in the x,y axis of the blocks adjust to those of the container block.
- This project helped us learn a great deal regarding intervals, game management, collisions, score count, position restart, and victory/defeat management.
